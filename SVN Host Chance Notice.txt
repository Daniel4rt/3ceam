On August 26, google code will begin to shutdown its services
by making all projects read-only. This means 3CeAM had to be
moved to a new host. The address to the new host can be found here....

SourceForge - 3CeAM V1
https://sourceforge.net/projects/v1-3ceam/

This marks the end of the project's life on google code.
I hate seeing google code get shutdown. It was a great place for
SVN hosted projects and was real easy and simple for me to use.
Now I gotta learn my way around a new place. *sigh* Oh well.
